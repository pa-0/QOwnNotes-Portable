# New Linux software repositories and todo list support

<v-subheader class="blog">Date: 2016-01-07</v-subheader>

A lot has happened the last weeks.

For more convenience there are now **software repositories** for **Ubuntu Linux**, **openSUSE Linux** and **Fedora Linux**, done with Ubuntu Launchpad and the openSUSE build service.

You will **not get any update notifications** if you are using the software repositories, since your operating system is doing the updates, but you can always visit the [changelog](https://www.qownnotes.org/changelog/QOwnNotes) to see what happened.

Visit the new **[installation page](https://www.qownnotes.org/installation)** for instructions on how to use them. There you will also find installation instructions for the other supported operating systems, like **OS X** and **Windows** and instructions on how you can **build QOwnNotes yourself**.

Furthermore, QOwnNotes got support for **managing your ownCloud todo lists**!

To manage your todo lists you need [**ownCloud tasks**](https://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/Tasks?content=164356) or **[Tasks++](https://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/Tasks+Plus?content=170561)** as backend, with which you also can manage your todo lists in the **web** and on your **mobile devices**.

Please be encouraged to report any troubles, wishes or ideas you have on the [QOwnNotes issues page](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues)!

You may also want to **subscribe** to the **[QOwnNotes RSS Feed](https://www.qownnotes.org/rss.xml)** to get the latest information about the project.
