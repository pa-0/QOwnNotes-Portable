# QOwnNotes Demo

::: tip Note
This might not always work, depending on the current state of the demo environment.
:::

You can try out **QOwnNotes** in your web-browser without installing it by
following these instructions:

1) Click on this [Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qownnotes/docker-desktop/main/examples/docker-compose.play-with-docker.yml&stack_name=desktop) link.
2) Click the **Login / Start** button (see screenshot bullet **1**) and login with your Docker account
   (you need to create one if you don't already have one).

3) Wait until the container is created and spun up. Then you should be able to
   click on **6080** on the top (see screenshot bullet **2**). If you get an
   error please wait a bit more and try to click *6080* again, it takes a while
   for the desktop environment to load.

4) A new browser tab should open producing a desktop. Click on the **bottom left symbol**
   on the screen (in the task bar), hover over **Accessories** and click on
   **QOwnNotes** (see screenshot bullet **3**).
